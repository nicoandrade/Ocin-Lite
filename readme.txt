* Social Menu
Using the social nav menu is just like using any other nav menu in WordPress. You just need to add custom links pointing to your social media profiles.

So, the first step would be to create a new menu under the “Appearance > Menus” screen in the WordPress admin. To add custom links to this menu, use the “Links” box. Just make a link to the social media profiles you want to display.

And, for the last part, be sure to select “Social” for the “Theme Location” before saving your menu.

* WooCommerce images size from the demo
If you want your images to look like the demo site, you should use this settings under WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Display > Product Images:
Catalog Images
348x218px
Single Product Image
869x543px
Product Thumbnails
197x123px
